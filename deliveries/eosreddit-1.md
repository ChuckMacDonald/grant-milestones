**The [invoice form](https://forms.gle/wLuAzXKa9qYrZQob9) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [Please, provide a link to the merged contract (the `.md` file in the [applications](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/tree/master/applications) directory)](https://github.com/Creamyvanill/grant-framework/blob/main/applications/eosreddit.md).

**Context** (optional)
> Our Mission with this Milestone is to Educate, inform and promote the world of cryptocurrencies about the most recent events on EOS and its technological improvements, generate active use of Reddit by promoting the adoption of EOS, promoting the different content of interest to users in Reddit.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
