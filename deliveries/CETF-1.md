# Milestone Delivery

**The [invoice form](https://forms.gle/wLuAzXKa9qYrZQob9) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/master/docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**

- **Application Document:** https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/applications/CETF.md
- **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**
Main objective of this milestone was to finish UI for the Phase 2. All the additions have been deployed to testing.eosetf.io and are being publicly tested.

We've had consulatation with a developer (Andreas Kolousmos) in regards to the smart contracts. Main recommendations were file structuring and formatting. We're in a process of refactoring the code to be compatible with clsdk.

**Deliverables**

> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.
>
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
