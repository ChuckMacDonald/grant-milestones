- **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**

Main objective of this milestone was to finish UI for the Phase 2. All the additions have been deployed to [testing.eosetf.io](https://testing.eosetf.io/) and now are being publicly tested.

We've had a consultation in regards to contracts. Main recommendations were file structuring and formatting. For the next milestone we'll further refactor the contracts to be compatible with clsdk, with more improvements in formatting and structure.
